# **Project Title: Performance of AM Receiver in the Presence of Noise**

This project explores the performance of Amplitude Modulation (AM) receivers in noisy environments. AM is a widely used modulation technique, but its susceptibility to noise can impact signal quality. We delve into the theoretical aspects of AM modulation and demodulation, analyze the effects of noise on AM signals, and discuss techniques to improve noise immunity.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **AM Communication Overview:** Introduction to the principles of AM communication.
* **Amplitude Modulation and Modulators:** Detailed explanation of AM modulation and various modulation techniques.
* **AM Demodulation:** Exploration of AM demodulation methods, focusing on envelope detection.
* **Noise in AM Systems:** Analysis of the impact of noise, particularly Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), on AM reception.
* **AM Receiver Requirements:** Discussion of the key requirements for an effective AM receiver.
* **Noisy Model of AM Receiver:** Development of a mathematical model to analyze the performance of AM receivers in the presence of noise.
* **SNR and Figure of Merit:** Calculation of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Figure of Merit (FOM) to evaluate receiver performance.
* **Threshold Effect:** Examination of the threshold effect, where low SNR leads to significant performance degradation.
* **Practical Applications of AM:** Discussion of scenarios where AM is used despite its noise susceptibility.
* **Noise Immunity Techniques:** Exploration of strategies to improve noise immunity in AM receivers.
* **Simulation:** Presentation of simulation results using GNU Radio to validate theoretical concepts.
